# Cursor Rules for Milestoner Project

## File Structure Rules
- Source code changes must have corresponding test changes
- Documentation must be updated when code changes
- Test files should mirror source file structure

## Naming Conventions
- Source files: snake_case.py
- Test files: test_snake_case.py
- Classes: PascalCase
- Methods: snake_case
- Private methods: _snake_case

## Documentation Requirements
- All public methods must have docstrings
- README.md must be updated for new features
- Design decisions must be documented

## Test Requirements
- Each source file must have a corresponding test file
- Test cases should cover both success and failure scenarios
- Test data should be realistic and well-documented

## Code Organization
- Related functionality should be grouped in the same file
- Common utilities should be in a shared location
- Configuration should be separate from implementation

## Example
When adding a new feature:
1. Update source code in src/milestoner/
2. Add corresponding tests in tests/
3. Update README.md with new feature details
4. Update any relevant documentation
